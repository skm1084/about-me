  <h1> A Little About Me </h1>
  <p>If I had to sum myself up in <em>one sentence</em>, it would go something like this: I'm a wife, mother, artist, color aficionado, weenie dog wrangler and dancing machine.</p>
  <p>I tend to look at life with a <b><font color = "ba882e">sense of humor</font></b> and a healthy dose of realism.  I enjoy the <b><font color = "ba882e">creative process</font></b> as much, if not more than the end result. Life is not only about how you look at it, but what you see. I try to take the time to be inspired by the subtleties in the world around me. Every moment has the potential to be great if you choose to focus on the <b><font color = "ba882e">positive</font></b>.

  <h1> Where I am From </h1>
  <p>I was born in the state of Virginia and grew up in a small town that bordered the state of Tennessee called Bristol. I was raised to believe in God, our country, sweet tea and Nascar (literally, I grew up a few miles away from the racetrack).</p>
  <p>Education was of the utmost importance to my family. The phrase I heard repeatedly in my youth was, "<em>No one can take your education away from you.</em>" I may be the artist in a family of doctors and business people, however I have never stopped learning and and trying better myself.</p>

  <h1> A Little More About Me </h1>
  <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
  <p>I love to <b><font color = "ba882e">dance</font></b>. I used to be a dancer in my younger days and even have a degree in it. Anytime is a good time for an impromptu dance party. </p>
  <p>I also love to refinish old furniture and give it a new life. I find a lot of joy in working with my hands to create something. Our house is never without a project in the queue</p>
  <h3>What is your dream job?</h3>
  <p>I have always joked that my dream job would be to name <b><font color = "ba882e">nail polishes</font></b>. Just think about it, someone actually does this for a job. How <em>fun</em> would that be? Ulitmately, I would love to own my own business but I haven't figured out my niche...yet.</p>
  <h3>What music are you currently listening to?</h3>
  <p>I have an eight month old, so there is a lot of "Old MacDonald," "Home on the Range" and "You Are My Sunshine" being played in our house right now. You wouldn't believe how many songs you learned as a child that you have to look up the lyrics to when you have your own baby.</p>
